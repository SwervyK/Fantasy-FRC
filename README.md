# Fantasy-FRC
Hello, I have created a website for running a fantasy draft with FRC teams. It handles everything from picking teams to calculating their score. I would love to open up my website to the entire FRC community but the server I am running the website on can not handle the traffic so I'm doing the next best thing. 

I am releasing the [instructions](https://aidankeighron.github.io/posts/how-to-setup-fantasy-frc/) so anyone can do a draft. Some key features of the website are:
- login system so only chosen users can participate in the draft
- automated drafting
- semi automated score calculation

The website uses Node.js to serve pages and MySQL as a database.
